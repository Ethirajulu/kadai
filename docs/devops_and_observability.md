## 1. Overview

This document outlines the core principles and practices for DevOps, observability (monitoring, logging, tracing), and testing within the Kadai platform. Given our microservices architecture, a robust strategy for these areas is not optionalâ€”it is essential for maintaining system health, developer productivity, and a reliable user experience.

## 2. DevOps Philosophy

Our approach is guided by the "You Build It, You Run It" principle. Teams that own a service are responsible for its entire lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and operational monitoring.

- **Automation First**: We automate everything possible, including testing, builds, deployments, and infrastructure provisioning.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure is defined in code to ensure consistency, repeatability, and version control.
- **Continuous Improvement**: We continuously measure our processes and seek to improve them.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

We use **GitHub Actions** for our Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/` directory.

A typical pipeline for a microservice (`<service-name>`) includes the following stages, triggered on a pull request to `main`:

1.  **Lint & Format Check**:
    - `npx nx lint <service-name>`
    - `npx nx format:check <service-name>`
2.  **Unit & Integration Tests**:
    - `npx nx test <service-name> --coverage`
    - A minimum coverage threshold of 80% is enforced.
3.  **Security Scan**:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scans to detect vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency scanning for known vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
4.  **Build Docker Image**:
    - `docker build -f apps/<service-name>/Dockerfile . -t <image-name>:<tag>`
5.  **Push to Registry**:
    - The built image is pushed to our container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
6.  **Deployment (on merge to `main` or `staging`)**:
    - Rolling updates are performed in the target environment (e.g., Kubernetes) to ensure zero-downtime deployments.

## 4. Observability Strategy (The Three Pillars)

Observability is how we understand the internal state of our complex system. We implement the three pillars: logging, metrics, and tracing.

### 4.1. Logging

- **Format**: All services MUST produce **structured JSON logs**. This allows for easy parsing, filtering, and searching.
- **Content**: Logs should include a `requestId` to correlate all logs associated with a single API request as it travels through the system.
- **Centralization**: All logs will be aggregated into a central logging platform (e.g., ELK Stack, Grafana Loki, or a cloud provider's solution).

### 4.2. Metrics

- **Collection**: We use **Prometheus** to scrape metrics from our services. Each service must expose a `/metrics` endpoint that Prometheus can read.
- **Key Metrics (The RED Method)**:
    - **Rate**: The number of requests per second.
    - **Errors**: The number of failed requests per second.
    - **Duration**: The distribution of time each request takes (latency).
- **Dashboards**: We use **Grafana** to build dashboards for visualizing these metrics, allowing us to see the health of our services at a glance.

### 4.3. Tracing

- **Framework**: We use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing. It is the most critical tool for debugging in a microservices environment.
- **Implementation**: The API Gateway generates a unique `traceId` for every incoming request and passes it in the headers to downstream services. Each service is responsible for propagating this `traceId`.
- **Visualization**: Traces are sent to a backend like **Jaeger** or **Zipkin**, allowing us to visualize the entire lifecycle of a request across multiple services, identify bottlenecks, and pinpoint the source of errors.

## 5. Testing Strategy

Our testing strategy is a pyramid, with a wide base of unit tests and progressively fewer tests as we move up to E2E.

- **Unit Tests (Jest & Pytest)**:
    - **Scope**: Test individual functions, classes, or modules in isolation.
    - **Goal**: Verify the correctness of business logic.
    - **Execution**: Run on every commit. They must be fast.
- **Integration Tests (Supertest)**:
    - **Scope**: Test the interactions between components within a single service (e.g., an API endpoint and its database).
    - **Goal**: Verify that the service's internal components work together correctly.
    - **Execution**: Run on every pull request in the CI pipeline.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Playwright)**:
    - **Scope**: Test a full user workflow across multiple services, simulating real user behavior from the frontend.
    - **Goal**: Verify that the entire system works together as expected.
    - **Execution**: Run nightly or before a production release, as they are slower and more brittle.

## 6. Local Development Environment

The complexity of the architecture presents a challenge for local development. Our strategy is twofold:

1.  **Full Stack via Docker Compose**: The `docker-compose.yml` file allows a developer to spin up the entire stack locally. This is ideal for integration and E2E testing but can be resource-intensive.
2.  **Service Stubs/Mocks**: For focused development on a single service, developers are encouraged to use stubs or mock servers (e.g., using `msw` or `nock`) to simulate the responses of dependent services. This reduces the local resource footprint and speeds up the development loop.
