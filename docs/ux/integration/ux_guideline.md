## ðŸ“„ Conversation Types & Design Prompts

### 1. Product Query Flow

**Prompt:**

### 2. Order Placement Flow

**Prompt:**

> Create a checkout flow. Customer confirms product â†’ bot generates order summary â†’ UPI payment link is sent â†’ bot waits for webhook status â†’ sends confirmation message with ETA. If payment not made in 30 mins, send reminder.

### 3. Seller Voice Ingestion

**Prompt:**
